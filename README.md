# Advent of Code

This is my (rather late) implementation of the 2019 advent of code puzzles.
These implementations are written in go and my goal is to implement them by
only using the official golang docs, no random blogposts or stackoverflow.

May the code be with me.

## Layout

* Each day is in a folder such as `2019/day-1` as `main.go`
* The inputs are in `input.txt` in that same folder
* Use `make day-1-part-1` to run a single one or `make all` for all of them
